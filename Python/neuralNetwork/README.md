For this project we need package "numpy", which is good in handling n-dimensional array.

https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

For example, I have install python 3.7, so then I have installed package as follow(windows 10, 64 bits):
"numpy‑1.16.4+mkl‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl"

Instruction is nothing special:
pip install numpy‑1.16.4+mkl‑cp37‑cp37m‑win_amd64.whl

To make sure that we have successfully installed the package, we can input "python" in the terminal,
-> if there is no error, then successful
-> otherwise you should change the environment variable.
